#SimpleChatJT

This repository contains the code for my Assignment 5 in my SEG2105 class.
For this assignment, I decided to expand off of my assignment 1 where I implemented the OCSF framework of the directory: https://github.com/TimLethbridge/Lloseng
and modify it for it to become Simplechat in this directory: https://github.com/JonathanTurriff/Lloseng.

Here are the changes made to the program:
- Created a GUI for the Client and Server interfaces of the ClientConsole and ServerConsole classes.
- Changed the EchoServer.java Class to implement having a ChatIF class tied to it.
- Devised a new function in EchoServer Called sendClientList() that sends a list of all current clients to the client logging in.
